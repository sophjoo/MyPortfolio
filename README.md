# [Project 1: Analyzing NBA Players Statistics (RAPTORS)](https://sophjoo.github.io/NBA_RAPTOR_Report/NBA_RAPTOR_Report.html)

* Identified associations between metrics in relation to ball possessions, season types, and player statistics with player and teamâ€™s performance by constructing graphs. 
* Collaborated in a team of three to examine 4684 NBA players with 23 variables using data visualisations on R Studio.
* Presented to statisticians on our comprehensive findings from assessing side-by-side box plots, scatterplots, contour maps, dendrograms, MDS plots, and pair plots.    

# [Project 2: Searching a Way to Increase Lifespan with Metabolic Rates](https://sophjoo.github.io/MetabolicRates/Report.html)
* Built linear models with R to predict lifespan from metabolic rates based on AnAge Database of 347 observations with 14 variables
* Transformed and smoothing splined variables due to finding key observations from exploratory data analysis to improve data quality.
* Evaluated models by computing cross-validation errors and bootstrapping.
