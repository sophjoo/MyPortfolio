## Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualizations, Modelling 

### [Project 1: Analyzing NBA Players Statistics (RAPTORS)](https://sophjoo.github.io/NBA_RAPTOR_Report/NBA_RAPTOR_Report.html)
* Collaborated in a team of three to examine 4684 NBA players with 23 variables by using data visualisations (ggplot2).
* Identified associations between metrics in relation to ball possessions, season types, and player statistics with player and team’s performance.
* Presented to statisticians on our comprehensive findings from assessing side-by-side box plots, scatterplots, contour maps, dendrograms, MDS plots, and pair plots.    

#### Preview of a few of the data visualizations:

### [Project 2: Searching a Way to Increase Lifespan with Metabolic Rates](https://sophjoo.github.io/MetabolicRates/Report.html)
* Built linear models with R to predict lifespan from metabolic rates based on AnAge Database of 347 observations with 14 variables
* Improved data quality by transforming and smoothing splining variables based on key observations from exploratory data analysis.
* Demonstrated how reducing metabolic rate increased a specie's lifespan by using 1000 bootstrap iterations and their confidence intervals. 
* Evaluated models by computing cross-validation errors and bootstrapping. 

### [Project 3: The Association of Air Pollutants and Mortality](https://sophjoo.github.io/Air_Pollutants/report.html)
* Processed a dataset about air quality and death rates in Chicago: 5114 observations with 6 variables (removed NA / unworkable observations). 
* Concluded about how air pollutants affect human's health by analyzing their death rates and how the number of mortality decreased after altering air pollutants values.
* Fitted poisson generalized additive models and spline smoothers on dataset for simplicity and better fitting. 
* Implemented a 5-fold cross validation to conclude about prediction errors of the models created.
* Conducted 1000 bootstrap iterations to find the pivotal confidence interval for deaths.  

## Natural Learning Processing

### [Project 4: Wikipedia Question and Answering System](https://github.com/sophjoo/NLP)
* Collaborated in a team of four to implement a system that generates a set of fluent and reasonable questions from a Wikipedia article on Python. The system also tries to return the correct answer for each question given the article. 
* Constructed WH-type and binary type questions from parsed sentences by tagging tokens based on parts-of-speech using tools from NLTK, SpaCy, and neuralcoref. 
* Achieved an overall grade of 88% for questions’ reasonableness and fluency from student judges in a blind setup.
