# [Project 1: Analyzing NBA Players Statistics (RAPTORS)](https://sophjoo.github.io/NBA_RAPTOR_Report/NBA_RAPTOR_Report.html)

* Identified associations between metrics in relation to ball possessions, season types, and player statistics with player and team’s performance by constructing graphs. 
* Collaborated in a team of three to examine 4684 NBA players with 23 variables using data visualisations on R Studio.
* Presented to statisticians on our comprehensive findings from assessing side-by-side box plots, scatterplots, contour maps, dendrograms, MDS plots, and pair plots.    

# [Project 2: Searching a Way to Increase Lifespan with Metabolic Rates](https://sophjoo.github.io/MetabolicRates/Report.html)
* Built linear models with R to predict lifespan from metabolic rates based on AnAge Database of 347 observations with 14 variables
* Transformed and smoothing splined variables due to finding key observations from exploratory data analysis to improve data quality.
* Evaluated models by computing cross-validation errors and bootstrapping. 

# [Project 3: The Association of Air Pollutants and Mortality](https://sophjoo.github.io/Air_Pollutants/report.html)

# NLP 
# [Project 4: Wikipedia Question and Answering System] 
* Collaborated in a team of four to implement a system that generates a set of fluent and reasonable questions from a Wikipedia article on Python. The system also tries to return the correct answer for each question given the article. 
* Constructed WH-type and binary type questions from parsed sentences by tagging tokens based on parts-of-speech using tools from NLTK, SpaCy, and neuralcoref. 
* Achieved an overall grade of 88% for questions’ reasonableness and fluency from student judges in a blind setup.
